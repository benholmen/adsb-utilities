# ADS-B Utilities
I'm using a [ADS-B receiver and a Raspberry Pi](https://flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/build) to capture live flight data. I'm feeding this data to [FlightAware](https://flightaware.com/adsb/stats/user/benholmen) and [ADS-S Exchange](https://globe.adsbexchange.com/) but I also want to do some basic inspection of the local aircraft.
